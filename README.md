# My Dotfiles

This repository contains configuration files for various tools I use. I developed them 
over the years as I refined my workflow. 
A quick rundown:

* The `nvim` directory holds my complete `neovim` configuration: a distressingly long `init.vim`, a few auxiliary files for setting mappings and filetype options, a steadily growing collection of Lua utility functions, and a few other goodies.

* The `bash` directory contains my `bash` configuration, split across several files.

* `misc` contains a few other files, such as my `zathurarc`, `inputrc`, and `tmux.conf`.

* The `setup_dotfiles.sh` script establishes symlinks to my dotfiles in the appropriate places, at least for an Ubuntu 22.04 machine.

By their nature, these files are perpetually unfinished and intended for personal use. 

Many pieces of files in this repository were copied or repurposed from StackOverflow posts and
the like. I did my best to credit the source whenever I did so.

Enjoy!
